# Warmup_Week02_Day04 ðŸ”¥
---
## You will be completing code for a Shape Abstract Class and 3 subclasses, Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle. Shape defines two abstract methods calculateArea() and calculateCircumference(). Both return doubles representing the area and circumference of the shapes respectively.
## For each shape you will have to create the necessary values need to calculate each of these values. You will also need to create constructors for each class, and the instructions for those will be included with each class.
## Provided below is a UML diagram that gives a visual representation of this warm-up.
